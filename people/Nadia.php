          Nadia joined Micron in September 2018 as assistant facility
          manager.  She assists with training new users,
          troubleshooting, maintaining and developing the equipment at
          the facility with focus on super-resolution and confocal
          microscopy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia received her MSc in physics and chemistry from the
          University of Pécs, Hungary and holds a Ph.D. in biophysics
          from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),
          Switzerland.  Her graduate work focused on elucidating the
          mechanisms of intra- and intercellular calcium wave
          propagation and cell-cell communication between arterial
          smooth muscle cells.  She then moved to Harvard Medical
          School as a postdoctoral fellow, where she investigated the
          effect of the mechanical environment on RhoGTPase signaling
          during cell migration.  Before Micron, Nadia was a postdoc
          at NDORMS, Uni. Oxford focusing on the influence of bone
          marrow adipocytes on breast cancer metastasis using 2D and
          3D microenvironments and developing image-based assays to
          validate in-cell efficacy of new probes and inhibitors,
          provided by the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC).  While
          at NDORMS, Nadia also managed the Botnar Bioimaging
          facility.
